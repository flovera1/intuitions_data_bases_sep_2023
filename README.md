# Intuitions upon databases 2023

We start from the second lesson to share these intuitions since it seems to be beneficial.

## Lesson 2
We covred the ER model, we shared the use of Lucid chart, and DIA as software to create such diagrams and we also did some exercises in the lesson! :smile:	This generated some inquiries!!
Unfortunately there is no such thing as a set of steps for creating ERs, we only need to practice as much as we can and understand the meaning of entities, relationships, roles and attributes. :rocket:	knowing the main concepts will ignite your curiosity and motivate to practice more and more.
